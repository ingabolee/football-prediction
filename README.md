## This project consists of 2 parts:

1. A Golang [data scrapper and formatter](https://github.com/ingabolee/football-prediction/blob/master/godi.go) for this [site](https://odibets.com/league)
2. A [Deep Neural Network](https://github.com/ingabolee/football-prediction/blob/master/football.ipynb) in Python

It is known that football is only 70% predictable. My neural network obtains a score of 73% for virtual games, which should be sufficient to make a profit.
